## Lessons Learned

Using OOP to implement different Design Techniques for real world objects.

* Strategy Pattern - 
    defines a family of algorithms,
    encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable

* Observer Pattern - 
    defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when
    one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically

* Factory Method Pattern - 
    defines an interface for creating an object, but lets
    subclasses decide which class to instantiate
